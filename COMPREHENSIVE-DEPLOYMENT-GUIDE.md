# 🚀 Complete AWS Deployment Guide for Your Accounting App

## Overview
This guide will deploy your backend to AWS and connect your frontend to it. Follow each step exactly.

---

## 📋 STEP 1: Create S3 Bucket for File Uploads

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://accounting-app-uploads-arsh-2024 --region ap-south-1
```

**Expected Output:** `make_bucket: accounting-app-uploads-arsh-2024`

---

## 📂 STEP 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd "C:\Users\imada\OneDrive\adal resume\Desktop\Arsh Project\ARSH"
```

---

## 🔧 STEP 3: Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**This will install all required packages for your backend.**

---

## ⚡ STEP 4: Test Backend Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Server running on port 8080
📊 Accounting Backend API ready
🌍 Environment: development
```

**Test it:** Open browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/health`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server when done testing.

---

## 📦 STEP 5: Create Deployment Package

### Method 1: Using Windows Explorer (Easier)
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to `C:\Users\imada\OneDrive\adal resume\Desktop\Arsh Project\ARSH\backend`
3. Select ALL files and folders (server.js, package.json, routes, config, etc.)
4. Right-click → "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
5. Name it `accounting-backend.zip`

### Method 2: Using Command Line
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory
cd "C:\Users\imada\OneDrive\adal resume\Desktop\Arsh Project\ARSH\backend"

# Create zip file (if you have 7zip or WinRAR)
# Otherwise use Windows Explorer method above
```

---

## ☁️ STEP 6: Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### 6.1: Open AWS Console
1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console/
2. Sign in with your AWS account
3. Search for "Elastic Beanstalk" in the services

### 6.2: Create Application
1. Click **"Create Application"**
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Application name:** `accounting-backend`
   - **Platform:** `Node.js`
   - **Platform version:** `Node.js 18 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023` (or latest)
   - **Application code:** Select `Upload your code`
   - **Source code origin:** `Local file`
   - **Choose file:** Select your `accounting-backend.zip`
   - **Version label:** `v1.0`

### 6.3: Configure Presets
- **Configuration presets:** Select `Single instance (free tier eligible)`

### 6.4: Create Application
- Click **"Create application"**
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployment to complete

---

## 🔐 STEP 7: Configure Environment Variables

After deployment completes:

### 7.1: Go to Configuration
1. In your Elastic Beanstalk environment, click **"Configuration"**
2. Find **"Software"** section and click **"Edit"**

### 7.2: Add Environment Properties
Scroll down to **"Environment properties"** and add these:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | `your-super-secret-jwt-key-arsh-2024-production` |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | `accounting-app-uploads-arsh-2024` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `AWS_REGION` | `ap-south-1` |

### 7.3: Apply Changes
- Click **"Apply"**
- Wait for environment to update (2-3 minutes)

---

## 🌐 STEP 8: Get Your Backend URL

### 8.1: Find Your URL
1. In Elastic Beanstalk dashboard, you'll see your environment URL
2. It will look like: `http://accounting-backend.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com`

### 8.2: Test Your Backend
1. Copy your URL
2. Open browser and go to: `http://your-url/health`
3. You should see: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","environment":"production"}`

---

## 🔗 STEP 9: Connect Frontend to Backend

### 9.1: Update Environment File
1. Go back to your main project folder: `C:\Users\imada\OneDrive\adal resume\Desktop\Arsh Project\ARSH`
2. Open `.env` file
3. Replace the content with:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://your-actual-backend-url/api
```

**Replace `your-actual-backend-url` with your real Elastic Beanstalk URL**

Example:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://accounting-backend.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api
```

---

## 🚀 STEP 10: Test Your Complete Application

### 10.1: Start Frontend
```bash
# Go back to main project directory
cd "C:\Users\imada\OneDrive\adal resume\Desktop\Arsh Project\ARSH"

# Start your frontend
npm run dev
```

### 10.2: Test Features
1. **Open your app** in browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
2. **Create an account** - This will test backend authentication
3. **Add a customer** - This will test database operations
4. **Create an invoice** - This will test complex operations

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] S3 bucket created successfully
- [ ] Backend dependencies installed
- [ ] Backend tested locally
- [ ] Deployment package created
- [ ] Elastic Beanstalk application deployed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Backend URL obtained and tested
- [ ] Frontend `.env` file updated
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend successfully
- [ ] Can create account and login
- [ ] Can perform CRUD operations

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Backend Deployment Fails:
1. Check the logs in Elastic Beanstalk → Logs → Request Logs
2. Ensure all files are in the zip (especially package.json)
3. Verify Node.js version compatibility

### If Frontend Can't Connect:
1. Check `.env` file has correct URL
2. Verify backend URL works in browser
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Verify JWT_SECRET is set in environment variables
2. Check that backend is running on correct port (8080)
